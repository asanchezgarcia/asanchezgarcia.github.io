I hold a PhD in Comparative Politics from the [Area of Political Science and Administration at the University of Salamanca](https://acpa-usal.com/member/alvaro-sanchez-garcia/). Previously, I completed a Master's Degree in Political and Electoral Analysis at the Juan March Foundation (UC3M) and a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Salamanca. I have been a visiting researcher at the [University College Dublin (UCD) School of Politics and International Relations (SPIRe)](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/), [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home), [Instituto de Ciências Sociais (ICS) da Universidade de Lisboa](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt), and [Università della Calabria](https://www.unical.it). 

Currently, I am a member of several research projects funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, including "Housing Outcomes, Mobility and Electoral Shifts from a Historical and Urbanistic Perspective (HOMES)" (UC3M) and "Feelings Of left behindness, electoRal behavior, and chanGes in pOliTical compeTition in European couNtries (FORGOTTEN)" (USAL). I have also taken part in completed projects such as: "Geography, Polarisation and the Rural-Urban Divide in the XXI Century" (UPF) and "Populism, Policy Preferences and Political Representation" (USAL).

Research lines: political geography, populist radical parties, economic geography and rural-urban studies.
