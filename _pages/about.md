I am a PhD Candidate in the [Area of Political Science and Administration at the University of Salamanca](https://acpa-usal.com/member/alvaro-sanchez-garcia/). Previously, I studied for a Master's Degree in Political and Electoral Analysis at the Juan March Foundation (UC3M) and a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Salamanca. I have been a visiting researcher at the [University College Dublin (UCD) School of Politics and International Relations (SPIRe)](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/), [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home), and [Instituto de Ciências Sociais (ICS) da Universidade de Lisboa](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt).
